## Installation

> **Warning:** This package will wipe your database and create a new admin user. Use only on a fresh Laravel project.

1. **Require the package via Composer:**
   ```sh
   composer require abhishekpriy9/bs5larastarter
   ```

2. **Run the installation command:**
   ```sh
   php artisan bs5:install
   ```
   - You will be prompted to confirm database wipe and admin user creation.
   - Follow the prompts to set admin name, email, and password.

3. **Install Node.js dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Vite development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   - For production, use:
     ```sh
     npm run build
     ```

5. **Access the admin panel:**
   - Visit [http://your-app-url/admin/login](http://your-app-url/admin/login)

## Usage

- **Admin Login:** `/admin/login`
- **Dashboard:** `/admin/dashboard`
- **Profile:** `/admin/profile/edit`
- **Settings:** `/admin/settings`

## File Structure

See the [stubs/](stubs/) directory for published controllers, views, assets, and routes.

## Customization

- **Views:** Edit files in `resources/views/admin/` for dashboard, login, profile, and settings pages.
- **Assets:** Customize CSS/JS in `resources/admin/assets/`.
- **Settings:** Extend `app/Models/Setting.php` and `config/settings.php` for site configuration.
- **Middleware:** Modify `app/Http/Middleware/AdminMiddleware.php` for access control.

## Troubleshooting

### Watchers Limit Exceeded Error

If you see an error like `ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached` when running `npm run dev`, you need to increase the watchers limit on your system.

**To fix this on Linux, run:**

```bash
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```

This increases the number of files your system can watch, which is required for Vite and Laravel Mix to work properly.

## FAQ

### Will this package overwrite my existing database?
**Yes.** The install command runs `migrate:fresh`, which wipes all tables and data. Use only on a fresh Laravel project.

### Can I use this with an existing Laravel app?
Itâ€™s designed for new projects. Using it on an existing app may cause data loss and conflicts.

### How do I change the admin panel URL?
Edit the published `routes/admin.php` file and update route prefixes as needed.

### How do I add more admin users?
Register new users via the database or extend the admin registration logic in your controllers.

### How do I customize the theme?
Edit assets in `resources/admin/assets/` and views in `resources/views/admin/`.
